Uber has identified that there is an issue with regard to availability of cars especially at the airport in one specific city where the airport is far away from the city. They want to identify why this issue exists. The task to identify the cause behind this issue. Following are the stages of analysis that  will be performed to get to the bottom of this problem. 

### DATA PREPARATION:
* plotted a grouped bar chart depicting the hour-wise trip request made at city and airport respectively.  Aggregated the data for all 5 days on the same axis of 24 hours. Each bar correspond to an hour and pick-up point (city / airport)  displayed in two colours 
* In the bar chart ), you’ll be able to see 5 major time blocks based on the frequency of requests made at the city and airport. I divided the request-time into 5 time-slots described below. I made an additional column “Time_Slot” which takes these 5 categorical values depending on the request time.
Pre_Morning
Morning_Rush
Day_Time
Evening_Rush
Late_Night
